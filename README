 Shamir's      Secret       Sharing      Service

====================================================


That's nice, but what is it?
----------------------------
This is a fork of the glite-security-ssss code at tag (version) 1.0.1
 -> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_Secret_Sharing


Maintainer:
Oscar Koeroo <okoeroo@gmail.com>


Original repository:
cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@glite.cvs.cern.ch:/cvs/glite co -d ssss org.glite.security.ssss


Products / tools:
- glite-ssss-generate-key
- glite-ssss-join-key
- glite-ssss-join-passwd
- glite-ssss-split-key
- glite-ssss-split-passwd
- ssss.h
- libglite_security_ssss.dylib


Motivation:
I've talked about this code many times in several fora since I helped the
original developer started on the first implementation. I'd like to help people
make easy use of Shamir's Secret Sharing algorithm by porting it, cleaning it
up and push it to several repos.


Current state:
- Messy code and error messages (signed errors)
- Man pages don't build, could do without XSLT.
- Apidoc doesn't apidoc the API.
- The gLite-isms need to go. I'll add an explicitly NOTES file to explain the
  origin.


Build guide:
sh bootstrap && ./configure && make && make install


Dependencies:
OpenSSL
xsltproc (for the man pages)
Doxygen (for the apidoc)
